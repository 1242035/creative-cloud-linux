## Filing a bug report

I accept bug reports for the Creative Cloud script, but please note that **I can't do anything about most bugs**. The Wine compatibility layer is used to run the Creative Cloud installer and all downloaded Adobe programs. If you have issues with getting certain programs to run, you should [file a bug report with Wine](https://bugs.winehq.org/).

When filing a Wine bug, please include the following information in your report to help the developers:

* You are using 32-bit Wine 2.20-staging
* You have the `msxml3`, `atmlib`, and `corefonts` winetricks installed

## Filing a pull request

Pull requests for the install script are welcome!
